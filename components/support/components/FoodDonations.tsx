      <h2>Your food donations help us feed our community</h2>
      <p>
        Eighty five percent of all of the food that goes inside our food boxes
        come from the generous support of our community. Thank you for your
        faithful help. Non-perishable food items can be dropped off any time in
        our food donation box located on the West side of the building. This box
        is checked several times each day. Someone is here for perishable items
        or if you need help on Mondays 9-6, Tuesdays 9-4, Thursdays 9-5 and
        Friday 9-noon. Please ring the buzzer on the West side of the building
        for help.

        beauty products shelf where we give out personal hygiene products,
        Perrigo products, laundry soaps and toilet paper.
