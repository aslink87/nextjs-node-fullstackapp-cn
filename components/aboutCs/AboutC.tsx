      <h2>Being Christian Neighbors</h2>
      <p>
        Christian Neighbors was founded in 1983 by the local churches to respond
        to people in need in our community. This allows the churches to minister
        cooperatively in ways they could not do alone. It is important to keep
        that long standing connection between the local Churches and Christian
        Neighbors. Most area churches support Christian Neighbors through their
        church budget, food donations and community soup suppers. Christian
        Neighbors stands ready to work with churches and church leaders as they
        refer people in need.
      </p>
      <h2>Being Community Neighbors</h2>
      <p>
        Christian Neighbors has become a community agency that is supported not
        only by Churches, but also by individuals and businesses throughout the
        community who realize that we must take care of others in need. The
        downturn in the Michigan economy has made an agency like Christian
        Neighbors essential and it has built a reputation throughout our
        community as a place where you will be helped when you are in need.
      </p>
      <h2>Being Cooperative Neighbors</h2>
      <p>
        Christian Neighbors has built cooperative relationships with Religious,
        Private, and Governmental Agencies committed to helping those in need.
        The Christian Neighborâ€™s Director and staff serve on and lead various
        task forces throughout our county dealing with hunger, poverty, and
        homelessness. They have built resources and developed referrals that
        address all of those concerns, as people come to them with varied needs.
        When you look at the yearly reports of Christian Neighbors, it is
        amazing the amount of help they provide, both food and financially.
      </p>
      <h2>Being Caring Neighbors</h2>
      <p>
        Christian Neighbors has demonstrated that our community cares about
        those in need. Christian Neighbors has also demonstrated that as a
        community works together, it can meet the needs that exist. People who
        go to Christian Neighbors for assistance are treated with caring,
        kindness and respect.
      </p>
      <h2>Being Continuous Neighbors</h2>
      <p>
        Christian Neighbors has been working to meet the needs in the Otsego,
        Alamo, Plainwell, Cooper, and Martin areas since 1983. Having a facility
        located in the heart of this service area, Christian Neighbors is
        positioned to continue to meet the needs of this area for many years to
        come.
