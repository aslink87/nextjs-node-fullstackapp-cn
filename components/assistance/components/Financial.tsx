      <h2>How do I get help?</h2>
      <p>
        When you first contact Christian Neighbors, you will come to our offices
        and talk to a case manager who will ask some questions about how many
        people there are in your family, how much money you make and what your
        current expenses are. You will be asked about any special circumstances
        that you are going through. We will talk to you about what things you
        have already tried to do to help yourself and find out what assistance
        you might be receiving from other sources.
      </p>

      <h2>State Emergency Relief Forms (SER)</h2>
      <p>
        DHHS requires the use of the MI Bridges web site for requesting state
        emergency relief (SER). Christian Neighbors is a Community Navigation
        partner with DHHS. We can help you complete the SER application and we
        can fax any supporting documentation to DHHS for you. Always follow-up
        with your DHHS case worker to make sure they received all necessary
        items. Have questions? Call 269-685-4166 ext. 102
